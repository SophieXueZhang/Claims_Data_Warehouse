- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive testing framework ensuring data reliability
- **Analytics**: Pre-built metrics for claims analysis and provider performance
- **Governance**: Data lineage, documentation, and monitoring capabilities
- **Reporting**: Executive-ready business intelligence reports with quantified insights

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Raw Data Layer (Healthcare Insurance Claims)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Staging Layer (Data cleaning & standardization)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Mart Layer (Dimensional models)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Analytics Layer (Business metrics & KPIs)
```

### Star Schema Design

![Star Schema](docs/star_schema_diagram.md)

## üìà Analytics Models

### üéØ Key Performance Indicators

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Business Value |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Financial** | Average claim amount, Total reimbursement, Cost per member | Cost management and budget planning |

- **`metrics_provider_performance`**: Provider benchmarking with specialty comparisons and performance tiers
- **`metrics_beneficiary_utilization`**: Member risk analysis and utilization pattern identification

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Quality Framework

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

Our data quality framework implements multiple layers of validation:

#### 1. **Schema Tests** (Built into models)
- Primary key uniqueness
- Foreign key relationships
- Not-null constraints
- Accepted value validations

#### 2. **Custom Business Logic Tests**
- Financial consistency (reimbursement ‚â§ claim amount)
- Date logic (end date ‚â• start date)
- Healthcare-specific rules (inpatient LOS validation)

#### 3. **Data Anomaly Detection**
- Volume anomaly detection using statistical methods
- Data freshness monitoring
- Cross-table consistency checks

#### 4. **Advanced Quality Metrics**
- **Data Completeness**: Percentage of non-null values
- **Data Accuracy**: Business rule compliance rate
- **Data Consistency**: Cross-table relationship validation
- **Data Timeliness**: Processing lag monitoring

### Quality Test Coverage

| Test Category | Test Count | Examples |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Schema Tests** | 45+ tests | Primary keys, foreign keys, not-null constraints |
| **Business Logic** | 15+ tests | Financial consistency, date validations |
| **Data Quality** | 10+ tests | Accepted values, uniqueness, relationships |
| **Total Coverage** | 70+ tests | Comprehensive validation across all models |

*Note: Run `dbt test` to execute all quality validations and generate current metrics*
